&lt;p&gt;What I am currently working on, is an app that lets a deaf person communicate with a blind person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this is bringing one of my previous apps* a few steps further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was coming up with a plan to put together living, open-source journals for my 2020 projects, I thought:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t I publish them all to an online blog?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus ensued the birth of the Build University website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*In 2019, I built Listenabel, an interface that reads labels aloud. As a side project, its progress has been slow but steady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to report that the home stretch is near — for making the app available for public use, including people who happen to be blind or visually impaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project won’t stop there, though. Nor will I.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kathy Li</name></author><summary type="html">Year 2020 has NOT been off to a good start for most of the world, which is why I am now more motivated than ever to squeeze my finite time on Earth to create useful tech.</summary></entry></feed>
